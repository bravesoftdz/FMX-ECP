# FMX - Enhanced Controls Pack
A set of Enhanced Controls for FireMonkey

The FMX Enhanced Controls Pack (or FMX-ECP) provides - imaginatively enough - a set of enhanced controls... for FireMonkey.

The primary focus is on providing enhanced versions of the standard FireMonkey controls to provide superior rendering performance (by use of caching and "Render Culling")

The secondary focus is on providing enhanced functionality where appropriate, and entirely custom controls to serve different purposes.

The FMX-ECP is licensed under the same terms as the LKSL (https://github.com/LaKraven/LKSL), which prohibits only charging for the distribution of the sources... so feel free to modify and use FMX-ECP as you see fit!

Donations, while by no means mandatory, are always appreciated... and can be made to PayPal [at] LaKraven (dot) Com (garbled to prevent automated spam)
